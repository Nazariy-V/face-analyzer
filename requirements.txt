opencv-python>=4.5.5
# NumPy must be <2.3.0 to remain compatible with some OpenCV wheels on Windows
numpy<2.3.0,>=1.21.0

# NOTE: Install PyTorch (torch + torchvision) separately using the PyTorch
# official selector (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) so you can
# pick the correct CUDA-enabled wheel for your GPU/driver. Do NOT rely on
# pip installing `torch` from this requirements file â€” use the command
# recommended on the PyTorch website for your CUDA version.
